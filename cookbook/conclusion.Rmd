# Conclusion for all Methods

Methods *PCA*, *MCA*, *PLS-C* and *BADA* doesn't seem to clearly separate different levels of happiness. However, *DiCA*, is clearly separating happiness levels and it shows that more amount of rain is correlated with decreasing happiness level and people seems to be more happy in countries with moderate temperature.

| PCA     | Temp                                      | Rain                         | Rain                                      | Components have significant contribution but convex hull has overlapping areas and Component 2 & 7 contradicts |
| MCA     | Lower Temp and More Rain                  | Higher temp vs less rain     | Higher temp vs less rain                  | Components have significant contribution but convex hull has overlapping areas                                 |
| BADA    | Temp                                      | Rain                         | Rain                                      | Components have significant contribution but convex hull has overlapping areas                                 |
| DiCA    | Higher summers, higher winters, less rain | mean of rain and temperature | lower summers, less winters, higher rains | Convex hulls are separeted but second component only has temp variables as significant                         |
