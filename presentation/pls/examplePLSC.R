# An Example of running a PLSC
# with TExPosition and TinPosition
# Script for RM3 2016
# Herv√© Abdi
#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# In this script we run a plain PLSC 
#  using tepPLS() from TeXPosition 
# and use ad-hoc code to perform standard inference:
# permutation and bootstrap test.
# We use data downloaded from the net
#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# First: A clean start.

file4PLSCfunctions <- 'pls/inferences4PLSC.R'
# the functions are in ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# This is the name of the file that stores the inference functions
# make sure that you saved these functions in this file

# Source the function file:
